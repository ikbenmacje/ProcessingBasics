## Resources

### Books

There are many good books on Processing and you can find a nice list of them on the Processing website [here](https://processing.org/books/)

My two recomadations to start with:

* Learning processing by Daniel Schiffmann (http://learningprocessing.com/)
* The Nature of Code by Daniel schiffmann (https://natureofcode.com/)

And when you have read those then you are ready for:

* Generative Design (http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/)
